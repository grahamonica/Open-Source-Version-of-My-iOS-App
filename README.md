# 🍰 HaveYourCake  

Hi! Welcome to **HaveYourCake**, where you can have your cake—and eat it too! 🎂  

## About the App  

This fun list-making app lets you:  
- Create lists that appear as **slices of cake** in a **pie chart** 
- Search through your existing lists 
- Add and edit lists, each styled to look like a slice of cake! 

##  Architecture and Third Party Integration

I built **HaveYourCake** using the **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture** to ensure a **modular and scalable** structure that’s easy to update.  

The app utilizes **Firebase** for:  
- **Data storage**  
- **User authentication** (Sign in with **Apple, Google, Username**, or continue as a **guest**)

The app utilizes **SendGrid** for:
- **Implementing the form on the Contact Us page**

## Status  

Right now, I’m holding off on publishing while I complete the **custom UI art**. In the meantime, I’ve attached **screenshots** where I used **AI-generated placeholder art** for testing.  

Stay tuned for updates!
